Different general purpose scripts that make my life easier

#### bulk_convert.pl
```
bulk_convert.pl [options] <extension> <directory of files>
```
Bulk converts images into vector (eps) format.  Basically, I'll have large directories of BMP or PNG images saved from simulation and when documentation time comes around, I need to supply the images in a vector format (otherwise we get really fuzzy, crappy images).  So this script will go through and create the eps images for me and I never have to do any extra work.
