Different general purpose scripts that make my life easier

## bulk_convert.pl
This allows me to convert different images saved from simulation into eps file for documentation purposes.  Basically, I'll have large directories of BMP or PNG images saved from simulation and when documentation time comes around, I need to supply the images in a vector format (otherwise we get really fuzzy, crappy images).  So this script will go through and create the eps images for me and I never have to do any extra work.
